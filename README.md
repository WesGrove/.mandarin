# DISCLAIMER

This has been made with Claude AI. I am not a professional in any way, I'm just a hobbiest with access to some good AI. That being said, this building style is very broken down and simplified, so at the least if it's not accurate, one could use it as a guideline for making an accurate one. If there are any linguistic experts out there, please let me know how I can improve this.

# TODO

remove tabulator reliance. debug everything you have so far BEFORE continueing.
brainstorm css styling by the individual component. AI cannot make an overview for you without fucking it all up. it can do little things though.
