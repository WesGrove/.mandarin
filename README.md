- Check that all HSK1 vocab pieces you have fit within 象形, 指事, 会意, 形声, Particles & Function Words. Check to see if there are other Parts of Speech covered in the HSK1 list i have now that are mislabeled. Correct any mislabelings and be make sure they're accurate. 

# hsk1.html
- Add flashcard carousels for each grouping in each section (need to come up with subsection goruping method)
- add breakdowns under each section's table for each vocab piece in the table that give a lesson on how to use the vocab piece. format it like its a markdown article, keep it centered in the page, keep styling in line with the rest of the html. 
- Adjust titling, labeling, and wording for optimal understnading and clarity.
- Debug page and fix
- Restyle and Reformat page to take more visual cues from hub.html and duolingos website. keep as true to current styling as possible. Claude should be "adjusting" not "redoing", i like the direction of the current hsk1_NEW.html, i just want some style adjustments.
