## HSK Level 5 New Vocabulary (1,346 Words)

CL: stands for "classifier" (measure word). Chinese uses specific counting words between numbers and nouns.
The bracketed items show the pinyin pronunciation of these classifiers:

- [ge4] = 个/個 - general classifier for most things
- [wei4] = 位 - polite classifier for people
- [zhang1] = 张/張 - for flat things (paper, tables)
- [ben3] = 本 - for books
- [jian4] = 件 - for clothes, matters

The | symbol separates traditional|simplified characters (e.g., 個|个).
